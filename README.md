# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Portfolio**, developed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**.  
This repository showcases practical examples of my technical skills and professional documentation, applied to real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

Each activity demonstrates my ability to utilise industry-standard tools, apply frameworks such as the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, and produce clear, professional reports for security analysis and incident response.

## 📂 Portfolio Content by Course

### **1️⃣ Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks**
- **Portfolio Activity:** *Conduct a security audit*  
  Performing a security audit to assess policies, controls, and compliance.

### **2️⃣ Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security**
- **Portfolio Activity:** *Use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to respond to a security incident*  
  Applying the NIST CSF to document the response process for a simulated incident.

### **3️⃣ Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL**
- **Portfolio Activity:** *Install and manage software in Linux using APT*  
  Practiced installing, verifying, removing, and reinstalling packages like **Suricata** and **tcpdump** using the Linux terminal. Documented the workflow with Markdown, Git, and Linux terminal.

- **Portfolio Activity:** *Navigating and searching files in Linux with basic commands and grep*  
  Navigated directories, inspected files, and used **grep** and pipes to filter logs and text for investigation.

- **Portfolio Activity:** *Manage files and authorization in Linux*  
  Created, removed, moved, and edited files, and managed permissions with `chmod` to enforce least privilege.

- **Portfolio Activity:** *Add and manage users in Linux*  
  Added and removed users, changed file ownership, and managed groups to control system access.

- **Portfolio Activity:** *Get help in the Linux command line*  
  Used **man**, **whatis**, and **apropos** to explore command documentation and differentiate between similar commands.

- **Portfolio Activity:** *Apply filters to SQL queries*  
  Filtered login attempts and employee records using **WHERE**, **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, and **LIKE** to investigate incidents and plan system updates.

### **4️⃣ Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities**
- **Portfolio Activity:** *Score risk based on likelihood and severity*  
  Conducted a comprehensive risk assessment for a commercial bank, assigning likelihood and severity values to multiple risks, calculating overall risk scores, and providing detailed notes and justifications based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

- **Portfolio Activity:** *Determine appropriate data handling practices*  
  Analyzed a data leak incident caused by excessive access permissions, reviewed **NIST SP 800-53 AC-6 (Least Privilege)**, and recommended control enhancements such as automated access revocation and role-based access controls to improve information privacy.

- **Portfolio Activity:** *Create and compare hash values in Linux*  
  Using SHA-256 hashing and tools like `sha256sum` and `cmp` to verify file integrity and detect subtle modifications.

### **5️⃣ Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response** - *In progress*
- **Portfolio Activity:** *Use SIEM tools to detect suspicious activity*  
  Using Splunk (SIEM) to create queries, analyse security events, and detect threats.

### **6️⃣ Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python** - *In progress*
- **Portfolio Activity:** *Automate tasks using Python*  
  Writing Python scripts to automate basic security analysis tasks.

### **7️⃣ Put It to Work: Prepare for Cybersecurity Jobs** - *In progress*
- **Portfolio Activity:** *Create a professional incident response report*  
  Compiling a comprehensive, professional incident response report integrating all prior skills.
