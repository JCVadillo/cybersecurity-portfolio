# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Portfolio**, developed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**.  
This repository showcases practical examples of my technical skills and professional documentation, applied to real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

Each activity demonstrates my ability to utilise industry-standard tools, apply frameworks such as the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, and produce clear, professional reports for security analysis and incident response.
