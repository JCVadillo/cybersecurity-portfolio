# Risk Scoring Based on Likelihood and Severity  
*Google Cybersecurity Certificate ‚Äì Course 04: Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities*  
*(Portfolio Activity ‚Äì Risk Assessment and Prioritization)*  

---

## üéØ Lab Summary  
In this activity, I practiced performing a **risk assessment** by evaluating common vulnerabilities that could threaten a commercial bank‚Äôs operations.  
The goal was to determine the **likelihood** and **severity** of each potential risk, calculate an overall **risk score**, and prioritize resources accordingly.  

This exercise aligns with the **Identify** function of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, focusing on risk management and asset protection.  

The main steps included:  
- Reviewing the organization‚Äôs operational environment.  
- Assigning **likelihood** and **severity** values (1‚Äì3).  
- Calculating overall **risk scores (Likelihood √ó Severity)**.  
- Writing notes to justify each evaluation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scenario Overview  
I recently joined a cybersecurity team at a **commercial bank** conducting a risk assessment of its operational environment. The bank operates in a **coastal area** with **low crime rates**, employs **100 on-premise** and **20 remote** staff, and serves **2,000 individual** and **200 commercial customers**.  

The bank‚Äôs services are marketed by a professional sports team and local businesses.  
Due to strict **financial regulations**, the bank must secure sensitive customer data and maintain sufficient cash reserves daily to meet **Federal Reserve requirements**.

## üßæ Risk Register Summary  

| **Asset** | **Risk(s)** | **Description** | **Likelihood (1‚Äì3)** | **Severity (1‚Äì3)** | **Priority (Score)** |
|------------|--------------|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Funds** | Business email compromise | An employee is tricked into sharing confidential information. | 3 | 2 | **5** |
| **Funds** | Compromised user database | Customer data is poorly encrypted. | 2 | 3 | **5** |
| **Funds** | Financial records leak | A database server of backed up data is publicly accessible. | 1 | 3 | **4** |
| **Funds** | Theft | The bank's safe is left unlocked. | 1 | 3 | **4** |
| **Funds** | Supply chain disruption | Delivery delays due to natural disasters. | 1 | 2 | **3** |

## üß© Risk Assessment Notes  

**Business Email Compromise**  
The bank employs many on-premise and remote workers who regularly exchange financial information through email. Attackers could exploit human error through phishing or social engineering to obtain sensitive data or credentials, making this a likely event with a moderate overall impact.  

---

**Compromised User Database**  
Weak encryption or misconfigured access controls could expose customer data stored in the bank‚Äôs systems. Given the strict financial regulations and large customer base, this risk could cause severe reputational and financial damage if exploited, even though it‚Äôs moderately likely to occur.  

---

**Financial Records Leak**  
If backup databases are improperly secured or publicly accessible, financial records could be exposed. While strong security controls reduce the likelihood, such a breach would severely impact customer trust, regulatory compliance, and financial stability.  

---

**Theft**  
Although physical theft is less likely due to low local crime rates and physical security measures, it remains possible through internal negligence such as leaving safes unlocked. Such an event would cause serious financial loss and regulatory consequences.  

---

**Supply Chain Disruption**  
As the bank operates in a coastal area, hurricanes or natural disasters could disrupt delivery schedules or supply chains. Although infrequent, such delays might affect operational efficiency and liquidity, resulting in moderate impact on daily banking operations.

## üß† Reflections / Notes  
- Conducting this assessment reinforced my understanding of **risk analysis** and **prioritization** within the NIST CSF framework.  
- I applied the **Likelihood √ó Severity** formula to identify which threats require the most immediate attention.  
- Cyber and operational risks‚Äîsuch as **email compromise** and **data breaches**‚Äîranked higher than environmental or physical threats.  
- Documenting detailed notes helped justify each risk score with evidence-based reasoning.  

---

## üìö Key Skills Demonstrated  
- Risk assessment methodology (**Likelihood √ó Severity**)  
- Application of **NIST Cybersecurity Framework ‚Äì Identify Function**  
- Evaluating and prioritizing risks in financial institutions  
- Understanding of **operational, cyber, and environmental threats**  
- Clear technical documentation and justification of risk scores
